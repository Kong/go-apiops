# This file describes the possible format of the supported patch operations by
# the CLI command `kced patch`.

# The current version only implements 'deck' format
_format_version: 1.0

# patches is an array of patches, to be applied in order
# the "format" key is optional. It is auto-detected based on the presence of the
# "patch", "operations", or "values" fields
patches:
  # Patch format: deck (these patches CANNOT error)
  # Media-Type: n.a.
  # Notes:
  # - this is equivalent to the `--value` flag on the CLI
  - format: deck
    selectors:
    - "a jsonpath query"  # defaults to "$"
    values:
      field1: any-json-value
      field2: any-json-value
    remove: ["field3", "field4"] # removes the fields, same as an empty value in the CLI


  # NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
  # Patch format: RFC-7396 (these patches CANNOT error)
  # Media-Type: application/merge-patch+json
  # Notes:
  # - if the target is not an object, the value is dropped and replaced by an empty object
  #   before the patch is applied
  # - if the patch is NOT an object, then the target is replaced with the patch.
  # NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
  - format: application/merge-patch+json
    selectors:
    - "a jsonpath query"  # defaults to "$"
    patch:                        # this field contains the "merge-patch" object as per the RFC
      field1: This object is the
      field2: merge-patch to apply


  # NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
  # Patch format: RFC-6902 (these patches CAN error)
  # Media-Type: application/json-patch+json
  # Notes:
  # - if "path" == "" then it targets the entire document, see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901#section-5
  # NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
  - format: application/json-patch+json
    selectors:
    - "a jsonpath query"  # defaults to "$"
    operations:                   # this field contains the "json-patch" array as per the RFC
      - op: add       # one of; "add", "remove", "replace", "move", "copy", "test"
        path: /a/b/c  # 'path' always is a JSON pointer; RFC-6901
        value: This is the new value
      - op: delete
        path: /delete/me
